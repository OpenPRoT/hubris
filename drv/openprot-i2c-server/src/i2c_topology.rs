//! I2C Bus Topology Management
//! 
//! This module handles I2C bus topology including controller management,
//! port validation, and multiplexer configuration. It abstracts the
//! hardware-specific details of how I2C controllers, ports, and muxes
//! are organized and accessed on the target platform.
//!
//! For mock testing, simplified versions are provided that bypass
//! hardware complexity while maintaining the same API surface.

// Hubris build system generated files
// These are automatically created during compilation by the build script (build.rs):
//
// pins.rs - Contains I2C hardware configuration specific to the target chip/board:
//           - I2cController: Defines available I2C controller instances (I2C0-I2C7 for STM32F4)  
//           - I2cPins: Maps controllers to port configurations
//           - I2cMux: Defines I2C multiplexer configurations (board-specific)
//           - CONTROLLERS, PINS, MUXES: Static arrays of available hardware
//           Generated by build.rs using build_util::expose_target_board()
//
// notifications.rs - Contains IPC notification definitions for task communication:
//                   - Notification masks and constants used by userlib for IPC
//                   - Generated from app.toml task configuration 
//                   - Created by build_util::build_notifications()
//
// Both files are written to OUT_DIR during build and included at compile time
// The build process is triggered by Cargo when building Hubris applications
